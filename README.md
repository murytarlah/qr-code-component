### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Animation

### What I learned

I got to learn about the SMACCS and BEM convention and tried implementing it in this project, although it's a relatively small project so might not be much, but looking forward to using more of BEM conventions on future projects

### Continued development

There won't be any aditional development on this project

### Useful resources

-   [`SMACCS`](http://smacss.com/) - This helped me understand how `CSS` can be broken down and modularised
-   [`BEM`](http://getbem.com/) - This is an amazing docs on `BEM` convention which helped me finally understand the naming convention in `BEM`. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
